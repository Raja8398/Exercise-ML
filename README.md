# Exercise ML

Exercise recognition is an emerging area in machine learning aimed at improving fitness monitoring and activity classification. This study compares three machine learning
models—LSTM, RF, and a hybrid approach combining RF PCA—for identifying five common exercises: Jumping Jacks, Pull-ups, Push-ups, Sit-ups, and Squats, utilizing a motion dataset
from Kaggle. The research emphasizes the balance between classification accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting the potential of the RF-PCA model to achieve rapid execution times without significant loss in performance. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing exercise recognition systems and pave the way for future real-time applications in fitness monitoring.
